Hipsum has a JSON API that anyone is welcome to use.

Please note that we do not offer technical support for this API. Additionally, if we find that a project or user is abusing the API endpoint, we reserve the right to disallow traffic.

The current parameters for our API are as follows:

Required
type — hipster-centric for hipster speak only or hipster-latin for hipster speak mixed with Latin words from Lorem ipsum.
Optional
paras — Number of paragraphs. Defaults to 5 paragraphs.
sentences — Number of sentences. This parameter overrides paras, so don’t use both at once.
start-with-lorem Pass 1 to start the first paragraph with the totally fucking ridiculous phrase “I’m baby”.
